				<h2>What is SOGIE? </h2>
			</div>
				<p>SOGIE stands for <em> Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity/Expression</em>.<br>

					<br/><b>Sexual Orientation</b> - Refers to the gender of the people one feels sexual or emotional attraction <br>
					for the same gender, opposite gender, both genders, all genders, and more<br>

					<br/><b>Gender Identity</b> - Refers to how one identifies as; man, woman, neither, fluid, etc. A biological <br>
					male can identify as a woman. A biological woman can identify as a man.<br>

					<br/><b>Gender Expression</b> - Refers to how one expresses their gender identity usually appearance, clothing <br>
					and behavior; most common classifications are masculine and feminine expression.<br>
				</p>

				<h2>Changes After Implementation</h2>
			</div>
				<p> 
				After the implementation of the SOGIE Bill, people afraid of expressing their SOGIE might feel safer as <br>
				society will hopefully become more open-minded and knowledgable about the said topic thanks to <br>
				the programs to be launched by the government. The summary of this bill, as we see it, is that people <br>
				who belong to the LGBTQI+ will get back their rights that are being tarnished by the unlawful <br>
				discriminatory practices implemented in our current society. 
				</p>

		I think that the SOGIE Equality Bill would be mainly beneficial for people. I am particularly in favor for the education systems they will implement, because misinformation is the main cause of the negative reputation of marginalized communities like the LGBTQ.</p>

		    In my opinion, I think the discriminatory acts need to be more broad, 
			and not limited to only gender discrimination as the bill implies.
			Furthermore, I hope that this will encourage Filipinos to be more 
			open to foreign ideas, as we are a religious country and there are 
			still some things that the older generation consider as "taboo".
			All in all though, I appreciate the bill and I would hope for it
			to be passed, as this will help many closeted people be less ashamed
			to be who they really are, as I personally know some people like them.</p>

		    The SOGIE Bill aims to protect the interests of not only the
		    LGBTQI+ community, but of every Filipino as well, and that's
		    why I agree with its implementation. It only has the good
		    intention of allowing everyone to have their own freedom of
		    expression without being discriminated due to the stereotypes
		    in our society.

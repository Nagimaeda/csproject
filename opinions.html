		<p class="opinion_left"> Repetitive since meron nang laws about rights. <br>
		Pero mas okay na i pass nalang rin kasi it protects <br>
		not just the lgbt community but also those who are <br>
		discriminated, such as single parents ganern	<br>

		I am in favor of the SOGIE Equality Bill, . . .I think that we<br> 
		should target to proper education and discussion about this topic,<br>
		 so that the stigma about this is lessened, as well as to be active in fighting<br>
		 for its approval because it is very much needed in our society today. <br>

		<p class = "opinion_left">
		i think that the sogie bill needs to be passed because this bill <br>
		will basically protect everybody's rights to be who they are. while<br>
		the bill is still imperfect, its general concept, which is to promote <br>
		equality and remind everyone that we all have equal rights,<br>
		is something that i am all for. <br>

		<p class="opinion_right">
		It is something long overdue, considering the fact that most of the <br>
		Filipinos are still conservative and closed minded with the community.<br>
		With the approval of the said bill, it would help the LGBTQIA+ community <br>
		in establishing a connection with our modern society without being treated differently. <br>

		I believe it's quite flawed in the way that reforms will be applied,<br>
		but overall I appreciate the idea and what they're trying to <br>
		accomplish. I just hope everyone can cooperate to #EndDiscrimination.<br>

		<p class=opinion_right>
		In my opinion the SOGIE Bill is important because all humans have <br>
		the right to be respected. However, I wish that it was not needed and <br>
		that respect would be common knowledge. Since it is not, and there are <br>
		humans who violate others rights especially the rights of those who identify<br>
		as a different gender and have a different sexual orientation, the SOGIE Bill <br>
		is an eye-opener and can hopefully reduce the number of cases of discrimination.<br>

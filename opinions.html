		I find the law a bit repetitive, since there are already laws <br>
		regarding equal rights rights. But I think it'd be better if it <br>
		was passed because it protects people; not just the lgbt community <br>
		but also those who are discriminated, such as single parents.<br>

		I am in favor of the SOGIE Equality Bill, . . .I think that we<br> 
		should aim to properly educate people and discuss this topic<br>
		 so that the stigma about it is lessened. We should also be active in fighting<br>
		 for its approval because it is very much needed in our society today. <br>

		I think that the sogie bill needs to be passed because this bill <br>
		will basically protect everybody's rights to be who they are. while<br>
		the bill is still imperfect, its general concept, which is to promote <br>
		equality and remind everyone that we all have equal rights,<br>
		is something that i am all for. <br>

		<p class="opinion_right">
		It is something long overdue, considering the fact that most of the <br>
		Filipinos are still conservative and closed-minded with the community.<br>
		With the approval of the said bill, it would help the LGBTQIA+ community <br>
		in establishing a connection with our modern society without being treated differently. <br>

		I believe it's quite flawed in the way that reforms will be applied,<br>
		but overall I appreciate the idea and what they're trying to <br>
		accomplish. I just hope everyone can cooperate to end discrimination.<br>

		In my opinion the SOGIE Bill is important because all humans have <br>
		the right to be respected. However, I wish that it was not needed and <br>
		that respect would be common knowledge. Since it is not, and there are <br>
		humans who violate others rights especially the rights of those who identify<br>
		as a different gender and have a different sexual orientation, the SOGIE Bill <br>
		is an eye-opener and can hopefully reduce the number of cases of discrimination.<br>

		I am in favor of the SOGIE Equality Bill, . . .I think that we<br> 
		should target to proper education and discussion about this topic,<br>
		 so that the stigma about this is lessened, as well as to be active in fighting<br>
		 for its approval because it is very much needed in our society today. <br>

		i think that the sogie bill needs to be passed because this bill <br>
		will basically protect everybody's rights to be who they are. while<br>
		the bill is still imperfect, its general concept, which is to promote <br>
		equality and remind everyone that we all have equal rights,<br>
		is something that i am all for. <br>
